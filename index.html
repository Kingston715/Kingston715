			<p> For the most part the main thing about fishing is where you like to fish and what bait your using for whichever fish. In this you will be able to see and learn the differences and have a better understanding of which lure to use and where you can potentially fish in bodied waters near you!</p>
		<div class="B1"><h2 id="Kinds"> Kinds of Fishing</h2></div>
			<p><b>Fly Fishing:</b>Fly fishing is a kind of fishing where you use artificial flies to entice fish to your line. It's an ancient kind of fishing that works very well for trout, salmon, bass, carp, and other species. Fly fishing is frequently done from the banks of rivers or while standing inside the river.</p>
			<p><b>Ice Fishing:</b>Ice fishing is the practice of using lines and hooks to fish in a frozen body of water through a tiny hole.</p>
			<p><b>SpearFishing:</b>Any type of fishing that includes impaling the fish with a spear mounted on a long pole is referred to as spearfishing. When the fish are visible, spearfishing is often done in shallower waters. You have to move swiftly and precisely to do it. Either from a boat or by wading into the water, you may spearfish.</p>
			<p><b>Noodling:</b>Noodling is a hand-gathering fishing technique in which the "noodler" dips their arm in a catfish hole in the hopes of getting bitten. Due of its risk, some states have made it illegal.</p>
			<p><b>Casting:</b>Casting is the process of launching your fishing line into the water using a flexible fishing rod. Whether or whether a fish is caught, casting is a sport in itself, with competitions rewarding participants for their accuracy and range.</p>
		<div class="B2"><h2 id="Location">Where to fish</h2></div>
			<p><b>Freshwater-</b>Besides the ocean, this applies to fishing in all bodies of water. This category covers lakes, rivers, ponds, creeks, and streams. Typical freshwater fish species include pike, trout, crappie, walleye, bass, catfish, and so on.</p>
			<p><b>Saltwater-</b>People often use this phrase to describe oceanic fishing. In actuality, saltwater makes up more than 97% of the water on Earth. It is obvious that saltwater bodies are where practically all fishing takes place worldwide. King salmon, redfish, bluefish, pacific halibut, striped bass, and other species are examples of saltwater fish.</p>
			<p><b>Stillwater-</b>In this typical fishing method, the fisherman drops the bait into the water and waits for the fish to find it.This fishing technique is incredibly simple, which makes it quite popular among novices. You may catch trophy fish like bluegill, chain pickerel, and largemouth bass when fishing in quiet waters.</p>
			<p><b>Running water-</b>Since the bait is put into a water current with this technique, it is essentially the reverse of stillwater fishing. Because of how tough this procedure is, beginners may find it impossible to try it. The award, though, will seem much more wonderful if you do accomplish.</p>
		<div class="B3"><h2 id="Types">Types of Lures</h2></div>
			<p><b>Crankbait:</b>The most common kind of fishing lure, crankbaits (also known as plugs), may be used to capture a range of species, from muskie to trout.</p>
			<p><b>Spinner:</b>The spinner, which was initially created for trout fishing, is still among the most lethal lures for trout. Inline spinners are excellent lures for capturing bass, pike, and muskie in addition to trout.</p>
			<p><b>Spoon:</b>One of the earliest kinds of fishing lures is the spoon, which is made of a bent piece of metal that sways when it is retrieved and emits flashes of reflected light in allÂ directions. Salmon, pike, and muskie are just a few of the larger fish species that may be lured using spoons when trolling.</p>
			<p><b>Soft Plastic Bait:</b>Soft plastic baits come in a wide range of forms, sizes, and colors and may be used with a number of finesse fishing setups or as a trailer with a jig head.</p>
			<p><b>Fly:</b>The original purpose of flies was to catch trout and salmon in streams and rivers, but they have now been modified to catch a wide variety of other fish species. In addition, many fly lures nowadays can be fished with an ultra-light spinning rod configuration and are excellent lures for catching trout, bass, steelhead, and salmon, whereas in the past a fly rod and reel setup was required to fish a fly.</p>
